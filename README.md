## Magis

Magis is flight controller software (firmware) used to fly **Pluto V3R** and **PlutoX** nano drones of **Pluto Platform**

This fork has been ported to C++ from cleanflight to support object oriented paradigm, which has been used to create different set of APIs for Pluto Platform which can be easily used by any **Developer, Tinkerer and Maker** to start their drone journey.
